    <h1 class="title">The Diary of a Poet</h1>
    <p class=".paragraph"> Wind Change <be> To the extremities where bones remain intact from soil and angels spill over the crevice of the forgotten. <br>
      Where light is begotten and negotiated with trust hindered from day one by those we call one another.
      <br>Where the besieged carry the synergetic heart of the world and our eyes perish with dried tears and the laughter seems almost inconsolable.
      <br>Those were the words I heard with the wind that fell while we dreamt. Where did the color green run to and the beautiful rainbow above disappear. 
      <br>Is anybody out there? Will there be a sea to bathe these times away?
      <br>Only our creator knows and while the clock lays on the wrist with serendipitous tactic we wait and wait but we do our best and then. We dissipate.
