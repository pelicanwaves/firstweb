    <h1 class="X">The Diary of a Poet</h1>
    <p class="XX"> Wind Change <be> To the extremities where bones remain intact from soil and angels spill over the crevice of the forgotten. Where light is begotten and negotiated with trust hindered from day one by those we call one another.
    Where the besieged carry the synergetic heart of the world and our eyes perish with dried tears and the laughter seems almost inconsolable.
    Those were the words I heard with the wind that fell while we dreamt. Where did the color green run to and the beautiful rainbow above disappear. Is anybody out there? Will there be a sea to bathe these times away?
    Only our creator knows and while the clock lays on the wrist with serendipitous tactic we wait and wait but we do our best and thenâ€¦ We dissipate.
